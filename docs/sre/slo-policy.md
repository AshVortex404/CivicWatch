# CivicWatch SLO & Error Budget Governance Policy

> **Academic / Project Context**: This document defines the engineering policy governing feature velocity versus reliability prioritization based on Error Budget consumption in CivicWatch.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

In Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), the **Error Budget** represents a quantitative boundary balancing product development velocity against system stability. 100% uptime is an unrealistic and counterproductive goal. Instead, the team uses the remaining Error Budget to guide engineering priorities in each sprint cycle.

## 2. Error Budget Status Zones & Operational Guidelines

| Error Budget Remaining (%) | Status Zone | Engineering Governance & Operational Action |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **> 25% Remaining** | **Green (Healthy)** | **Normal Feature Velocity**: Feature development proceeds normally. Production deployments follow standard continuous deployment pipelines. Risk-taking (e.g. non-disruptive architectural refactoring) is acceptable. |
| **10% - 25% Remaining** | **Yellow (Warning)** | **Reliability Prioritization**: Non-urgent feature releases require enhanced review. Sprint capacity is allocated 50/50 between new feature development and reliability tasks (e.g., performance tuning, automated test coverage, query indexing). |
| **< 10% or Exhausted (0%)** | **Red (Exhausted / Frozen)** | **Feature Freeze & Reliability Priority**: Non-emergency feature deployments are paused. **100% of engineering effort** is shifted to reliability work, root-cause resolution, infrastructure resilience, and incident prevention until error budget recovers. |

## 3. Exception & Escalation Process

- **Emergency Hotfixes**: Critical security patches or emergency bug fixes required to restore service availability are permitted during a feature freeze, subject to SRE Lead approval.
- **Error Budget Reset**: Error budgets are evaluated on a 30-day rolling window. Once past outage events roll out of the 30-day evaluation window, normal feature velocity automatically resumes if remaining budget rises above 25%.

## 4. Summary of Reliability Mindset

> *"The error budget is not a target to be hoard or feared; it is a budget to be spent deliberately to balance innovation speed with user satisfaction."*
